# 🏦📉 Loan Default Prediction
Who is likely to default on a loan? What financial patterns signal default risk?  
This machine learning project explores borrower data to predict defaults and support better lending decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze borrower and loan-related data to uncover risk factors for default
- Build machine learning models to classify default vs. non-default customers
- Identify key financial and behavioral predictors
- Translate model output into actionable insights for lending institutions
